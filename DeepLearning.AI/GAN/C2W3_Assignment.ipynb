    "## Truncation Trick\n",
    "The first component you will implement is the truncation trick. Remember that this is done after the model is trained and when you are sampling beautiful outputs. The truncation trick resamples the noise vector $z$ from a truncated normal distribution which allows you to tune the generator's fidelity/diversity. The truncation value is at least 0, where 1 means there is little truncation (high diversity) and 0 means the distribution is all truncated except for the mean (high quality/fidelity). This trick is not exclusive to StyleGAN. In fact, you may recall playing with it in an earlier GAN notebook."

For example, imagine an image has 512 channels and its height and width are (4 x 4). You would first create a random (4 x 4) noise matrix with one channel. Then, your model would create 512 values—one for each channel. Next, you multiply the (4 x 4) matrix by each one of these values. This creates a \"random\" tensor of 512 channels and (4 x 4) pixels, the same dimensions as the image. Finally, you add this noise tensor to the image. This introduces uncorrelated noise and is meant to increase the diversity in the image.\n",

    "The next component you will implement is AdaIN. To increase control over the image, you inject $w$ — the intermediate noise vector — multiple times throughout StyleGAN. This is done by transforming it into a set of style parameters and introducing the style to the image through AdaIN. Given an image ($x_i$) and the intermediate vector ($w$), AdaIN takes the instance normalization of the image and multiplies it by the style scale ($y_s$) and adds the style bias ($y_b$). You need to calculate the learnable style scale and bias by using linear mappings from $w$.\n",

    "Now, you can implement progressive growing. \n",

    "StyleGAN starts with a constant 4 x 4 (x 512 channel) tensor which is put through an iteration of the generator without upsampling. The output is some noise that can then be transformed into a blurry 4 x 4 image. This is where the progressive growing process begins. The 4 x 4 noise can be further passed through a generator block with upsampling to produce an 8 x 8 output. However, this will be done gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will simulate progressive growing from an 8 x 8 image to a 16 x 16 image. Instead of simply passing it to the generator block with upsampling, StyleGAN gradually trains the generator to the new size by mixing in an image that was only upsampled. By mixing an upsampled 8 x 8 image (which is 16 x 16) with increasingly more of the 16 x 16 generator output, the generator is more stable as it progressively trains. As such, you will do two separate operations with the 8 x 8 noise:\n",

    "You will now have two images that are both double the resolution of the 8 x 8 noise. Then, using an alpha ($\\alpha$) term, you combine the higher resolution images obtained from (1) and (2). You would then pass this into the discriminator and use the feedback to update the weights of your generator. The key here is that the $\\alpha$ term is gradually increased until eventually, only the image from (1), the generator, is used. That is your final image or you could continue this process to make a 32 x 32 image or 64 x 64, 128 x 128, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "This micro model you will implement will visualize what the model outputs at a particular stage of training, for a specific value of $\\alpha$. However to reiterate, in practice, StyleGAN will slowly phase out the upsampled image by increasing the $\\alpha$ parameter over many training steps, doing this process repeatedly with larger and larger alpha values until it is 1—at this point, the combined image is solely comprised of the image from the generator block. This method of gradually training the generator increases the stability and fidelity of the model.\n",
